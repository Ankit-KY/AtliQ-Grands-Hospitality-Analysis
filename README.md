# Recommendations

- Customer ratings can be enhanced through superior service, cleanliness, quality food, etc., as these factors directly influence bookings and revenue.
- Given the overall occupancy rate is 57.59%, the management team can dynamically adjust room prices in properties with low occupancy rates.
- Makeyourtrip is the second largest source of bookings (9K), but the cancellation rate is 25.03% across all cities and properties. The management team should address this issue, as it affects hotel rankings in search results, leading to decreased revenue and fewer bookings.
- The Average Daily Rate (ADR) remains consistent on weekdays and weekends, indicating an opportunity for dynamic pricing across all properties and platforms to generate additional revenue.
